arithmetic_test.py is destined to contain the source code that we want to compile.

arithmetic_back_end.py is the source code for the compiler.

Simply run arithmetic_back_end.py and it will print out the compiled code(it will look for arithmetic_test.py). Alternatively, the opcode is also stored in the variable 'opcode'. The details are explained in the documentation.
